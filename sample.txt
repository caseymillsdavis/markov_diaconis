It is a common belief that learning two languages calls for twice as much
effort as learning one. This may be roughly true, if the two languages are not
more alike than French and German, and if the beginner's aim is to speak either
like a native. If they belong to the same family, and if the beginner has
a more modest end in view, it is not true. Many people will find that the
effort spent on building up a small, workmanlike vocabulary and getting a grasp
of essential grammatical peculiarities of four closely related languages is not
much greater than the effort spent on getting an equivalent knowledge of one
alone. The reason for this is obvious if we approach learning languages as
a problem of applied biology. The ease with which we remember things depends on
being able to associate one thing with another. In many branches of knowledge,
a little learning is a difficult thing.
