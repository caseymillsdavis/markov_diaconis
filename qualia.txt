I hate to admit it, but I'm not enjoying this work anymore. When I came to
Maxwell House six years ago, I thought Maxwell House coffee was the best
tasting coffee in the world. I was proud to have a share in the responsibility
for preserving that flavour over the years. And we've done our job well; the
coffee tastes just the same today as it tasted when I arrived. But, you know,
I no longer like it! My tastes have changed. I've become a more sophisticated
coffee drinker. I no longer like that taste at all.
